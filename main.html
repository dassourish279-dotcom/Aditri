        you have been suffering thorugh a lot, but now I have finally realised my mistake. When I was lost you were the one who took
        me up from the darkness. You  have great significance in my life and I dont want you to just step out of my life. You maybe not my
        first true love but you are the one who loved me. I know I have hurt you a lot but my love was true. I still love you.</strong>
